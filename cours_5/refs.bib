  abstract = {Sentiment is fundamental to human communication. Countless marketing applications mine opinions from social media communication, news articles, customer feedback, or corporate communication. Various sentiment analysis methods are available and new ones have recently been proposed. Lexicons can relate individual words and expressions to sentiment scores. In contrast, machine learning methods are more complex to interpret, but promise higher accuracy, i.e., fewer false classifications. We propose an empirical framework and quantify these trade-offs for different types of research questions, data characteristics, and analytical resources to enable informed method decisions contingent on the application context. Based on a meta-analysis of 272 datasets and 12 million sentimentlabeled text documents, we find that the recently proposed transfer learning models indeed perform best, but can perform worse than popular leaderboard benchmarks suggest. We quantify the accuracy-interpretability trade-off, showing that, compared to widely established lexicons, transfer learning models on average classify more than 20 percentage points more documents correctly. To form realistic performance expectations, additional context variables, most importantly the desired number of sentiment classes and the text length, should be taken into account. We provide a pre-trained sentiment analysis model (called SiEBERT) with open-source scripts that can be applied as easily as an off-the-shelf lexicon.},

  abstract = {The increasing importance and proliferation of text data provide a unique opportunity and novel lens to study human communication across a myriad of business and marketing applications. For example, consumers compare and review products online, individuals interact with their voice assistants to search, shop, and express their needs, investors seek to extract signals from firms’ press releases to improve their investment decisions, and firms analyze sales call transcripts to increase customer satisfaction and conversions. However, extracting meaningful information from unstructured text data is a nontrivial task. In this chapter, we review established natural language processing (NLP) methods for traditional tasks (e.g., LDA for topic modeling and lexicons for sentiment analysis and writing style extraction) and provide an outlook into the future of NLP in marketing, covering recent embedding-based approaches, pretrained language models, and transfer learning for novel tasks such as automated text generation and multi-modal representation learning. These emerging approaches allow the field to improve its ability to perform certain tasks that we have been using for more than a decade (e.g., text classification). But more importantly, they unlock entirely new types of tasks that bring about novel research opportunities (e.g., text summarization, and generative question answering). We conclude with a roadmap and research agenda for promising NLP applications in marketing and provide supplementary code examples to help interested scholars to explore opportunities related to NLP in marketing.},

  abstract = {In the rapidly advancing age of Generative AI, Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT stand at the forefront of disrupting marketing practice and research. This paper presents a comprehensive exploration of LLMs’ proficiency in sentiment analysis, a core task in marketing research for understanding consumer emotions, opinions, and perceptions. We benchmark the performance of three state-of-the-art LLMs, i.e., GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Llama 2, against established, highperforming transfer learning models. Despite their zero-shot nature, our research reveals that LLMs can not only compete with but in some cases also surpass traditional transfer learning methods in terms of sentiment classification accuracy. We investigate the influence of textual data characteristics and analytical procedures on classification accuracy, shedding light on how data origin, text complexity, and prompting techniques impact LLM performance. We find that linguistic features such as the presence of lengthy, content-laden words improve classification performance, while other features such as singlesentence reviews and less structured social media text documents reduce performance. Further, we explore the explainability of sentiment classifications generated by LLMs. The findings indicate that LLMs, especially Llama 2, offer remarkable classification explanations, highlighting their advanced human-like reasoning capabilities. Collectively, this paper enriches the current understanding of sentiment analysis, providing valuable insights and guidance for the selection of suitable methods by marketing researchers and practitioners in the age of Generative AI.},

  abstract = {Customers increasingly rely on other consumers’ reviews to make purchase decisions online. New insights into the customer review phenomenon can be derived from studying the semantic content and style properties of verbatim customer reviews to examine their influence on online retail sites’ conversion rates. The authors employ text mining to extract changes in affective content and linguistic style properties of customer book reviews on Amazon.com. A dynamic panel data model reveals that the influence of positive affective content on conversion rates is asymmetrical, such that greater increases in positive affective content in customer reviews have a smaller effect on subsequent increases in conversion rate. No such tapering-off effect occurs for changes in negative affective content in reviews. Furthermore, positive changes in affective cues and increasing congruence with the product interest group’s typical linguistic style directly and conjointly increase conversion rates. These findings suggest that managers should identify and promote the most influential reviews in a given product category, provide instructions to stimulate reviewers to write powerful reviews, and adapt the style of their own editorial reviews to the relevant product category.},

The procedure essentially involves the construction of functions of the observed proportions which are directed at the extent to which the observers agree among themselves and the construction of test statistics for hypotheses involving these functions. Tests for interobserver bias are presented in terms of first-order marginal homogeneity and measures of interobserver agreement are developed as generalized kappa-type statistics. These procedures are illustrated with a clinical diagnosis example from the epidemiological literature.},

The analysis of sentiment on social networks, such as Twitter or Facebook, has become a powerful means of learning about the users' opinions and has a wide range of applications. However, the efficiency and accuracy of sentiment analysis is being hindered by the challenges encountered in natural language processing (NLP). In recent years, it has been demonstrated that deep learning models are a promising solution to the challenges of NLP. This paper reviews the latest studies that have employed deep learning to solve sentiment analysis problems, such as sentiment polarity. Models using term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) and word embedding have been applied to a series of datasets. Finally, a comparative study has been conducted on the experimental results obtained for the different models and input features.},

Through these resources, users from all over the world express and share their opinions about a variety of subjects. The analysis of such a huge amount of user generated data manually is impossible, therefore an effective and intelligent technique is needed which can analyze and provide the polarity of this textual data. Multiple tools and techniques are available today for automatic sentiment classification for this user generated data. Mostly, three approaches are used for this purpose Lexicon based techniques, Machine Learning based techniques and hybrid techniques (which combines lexicon based and machine learning based approach). Machine Learning approach is effective and reliable for opinion mining and sentiment classification. Many variants and extensions of machine learning techniques and tools are available today. The purpose of this study is to explore the different machine learning techniques to identify its importance as well as to raise an interest for this research area.},

  abstract = {In machine learning (ML), a widespread claim is that the area under the precisionrecall curve (AUPRC) is a superior metric for model comparison to the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) for tasks with class imbalance. This paper refutes this notion on two fronts. First, we theoretically characterize the behavior of AUROC and AUPRC in the presence of model mistakes, establishing clearly that AUPRC is not generally superior in cases of class imbalance. We further show that AUPRC can be a harmful metric as it can unduly favor model improvements in subpopulations with more frequent positive labels, heightening algorithmic disparities. Next, we empirically support our theory using experiments on both semi-synthetic and real-world fairness datasets. Prompted by these insights, we reviewed over 1.5 million scientific papers to understand the origin of this invalid claim--finding it is often made without citation, misattributed to papers that do not argue this point, and aggressively overgeneralized from source arguments. Our findings represent a dual contribution: a significant technical advancement in understanding the relationship between AUROC and AUPRC and a stark warning about unchecked assumptions in the ML community.},
